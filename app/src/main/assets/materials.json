Repak ELT Registered Collectors will collect tyre waste from Repak ELT member outlets and will only be paid once they have submitted documentation proving that the tyres they collected were managed in an environmentally sound manner. Producer responsibility initiatives in other waste streams have transformed waste with a negative value to one of positive value as a resource for recycled material and innovative green products. Tyres are currently a resource in that they can be recycled, recovered and processed. Repak ELT tyre compliance scheme will work to bring improved environmental outcomes for end of life tyres.
